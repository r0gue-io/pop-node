/// - a getter message `get` that returns the current `bool` value.

	/// every such dependency (including the contract from the current crate), it will generate a
	/// [`ContractBundle`](drink::session::ContractBundle) object that contains the compiled
	/// contract's code and a special transcoder, which is used to encode and decode the contract's
	/// message arguments. Such a bundle will be useful when deploying a contract.
	///
	/// To get a convenient way for obtaining such bundles, we can define an empty enum and mark
	/// it with the [`drink::contract_bundle_provider`](drink::contract_bundle_provider) attribute.
	/// From now on, we can use it in all testcases in this module.

	/// Now we write the simplest contract test, that will:
	/// 1. Deploy the contract.
	/// 2. Call its `flip` method.
	/// 3. Call its `get` method and ensure that the stored value has been flipped.
	///
	/// We can use the [`drink::test`](drink::test) attribute to mark a function as a `drink` test.
	/// This way we ensure that all the required contracts are compiled and built, so that we don't
	/// have to run `cargo contract build` manually for every contract dependency.
	///
	/// For convenience of using `?` operator, we mark the test function as returning a `Result`.
	///
	/// `drink::test` will already provide us with a `Session` object. It is a wrapper around a
	/// runtime and it exposes a broad API for interacting with it. Session is generic over the
	/// runtime type, but usually and by default, we use `MinimalSandbox`, which is a minimalistic
	/// runtime that allows using smart contracts.
