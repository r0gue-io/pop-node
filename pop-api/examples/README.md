## Pop API Examples

The example contracts demonstrate how to use the `pop_api` interface with [ink!](https://use.ink).

## Warning

The available contracts are *examples* demonstrating usage of Pop's smart contract API. They are neither audited nor
endorsed for production use. Do **not** rely on them to keep anything of value secure.

## Development

### Prerequisite

[Pop CLI](https://github.com/r0gue-io/pop-cli) installed.

### Launching a local Pop Network

The example contracts only work with Pop Network runtimes due to their usage of Pop's smart contract API. To run
`pop-node` locally, you can use the following command:

```bash
pop up network -f ./networks/devnet.toml
```

The output should provide a command for following the logs emitted from `pop-node`, which can be useful for debugging:

```
 logs: tail -f /var/folders/mr/gvb9gkhx58x2mxbpc6dw77ph0000gn/T/zombie-d9983e5b-fc70-478d-b943-d920a659d308/pop/pop.log
```

> ðŸ“š See the full guide to launching a chain
> locally [here](https://learn.onpop.io/appchains/guides/launch-a-chain/running-your-parachain).

### Build a contract

Run the below command to build the contract:

```bash
pop build -r
```

This builds the contract in release mode.

### Upload and instantiate a contract

Upload your contract to the local instance of Pop Network you launched above with the following command, replacing the
url with that shown in the output of the `pop up network` command.

```bash
pop up contract \
    --url=ws://127.0.0.1:9944 \
    # The value provided at instantiation (via `payable`).
    --value 100000000000 \
    # Using Alice as the contract owner, you can provide `--use-wallet` to sign with your own wallet.
    --suri //Alice \
    # Provide the constructor args
    --args ...
```
